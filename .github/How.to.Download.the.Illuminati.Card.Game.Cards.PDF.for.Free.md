## How to Play the Illuminati Card Game
 
The Illuminati Card Game is a complex and strategic game that can be played by two to six players. The goal of the game is to take control of various groups and organizations that are part of a global conspiracy. Each player represents a different faction of the Illuminati, such as The Bavarian Illuminati, The Discordian Society, or The UFOs.
 
The game consists of three types of cards: Illuminati cards, group cards, and special cards. Illuminati cards are the ones that represent the players' factions. Group cards are the ones that represent various groups and organizations that can be controlled by the players. Special cards are the ones that have various effects on the game, such as events, actions, or resources.
 
The game is played in turns. Each turn consists of four phases: income, action, attack, and end. During each phase, players can perform various actions, such as collecting money, playing cards, attacking other groups, or defending their own groups. The game ends when one player meets their victory condition, which depends on their faction.
 
The rules of the game are quite detailed and complex, so we recommend reading them carefully before playing. You can find them on [illuminaticardgame.com/rules/](https://illuminaticardgame.com/rules/) or in the PDF file you downloaded.
